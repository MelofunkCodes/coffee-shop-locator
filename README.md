##Coffee-Shop Locator

Simple website created from a youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1_sUMw8kwg) using the Google Maps library.

I got the initial setup to work where upon refresh, it shows all the cafe's or shoe_stores within a 5 mile radius from WeWork Montreal. Users can click on the markers to get the name of the service. 

(Wasn't able to get a marker refresh to happen if user scrolls over to another location 5miles+ away from initial origin. )
